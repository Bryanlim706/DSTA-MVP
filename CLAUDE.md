# CLAUDE.md — Software Quality Evaluator

Read this file at the start of every session to get full context on the project.

---

## What this project is

A system that evaluates software **Functional Suitability (ISO 25010)** by analysing an uploaded codebase against user-provided requirements. Scores are formula-driven — the LLM explains results, never overrides them.

See `PLAN.md` for the full pipeline design, 4-layer model, and scoring formulas.

## What has been built

### Step 0 — Project Type & Scope Classifier (COMPLETE)
- User uploads a `.zip` of their project + requirements text via the React frontend
- Backend saves the zip, creates a job (JSON file), runs Step 0 in the background
- Rule-based first (config files + extension counts); LLM (claude-haiku, prompt caching) called only when confidence is medium or rules produce no match
- `test_strategy` always formula-derived from `project_type` + `backend_framework` — LLM never overrides it
- Root-level Python check: Python configs only found in sub-service directories (depth 2+) are ignored for framework detection — triggers LLM fallback to handle multi-service apps correctly

**Step 0 output fields** (stored in `step_results.step_0`):
```
project_type, frontend_framework, backend_framework,
confidence, reasoning, test_strategy,
config_files_found, llm_used, llm_model
```
`primary_language` is NOT in Step 0 output — Step 4 produces the authoritative `languages` array from source parsing.

### Step 1 — Stated Requirement Extractor (COMPLETE)
- Scans uploaded zip for README files (capped at depth ≤ 2) and spec docs (keyword-matched .md/.rst/.txt)
- Ignores tool config dirs: `.claude`, `.cursor`, `.github`, `.vscode`, `.idea` (these waste slots)
- MAX_DOCS = 30, MAX_CHARS_PER_DOC = 12000
- LLM (claude-haiku) extracts only explicitly stated requirements; every item must include a verbatim source quote
- JSON truncation recovery: if response is cut off mid-array, recovers items up to last complete `},`
- `excluded_docs_count` in result shows how many spec docs were found but dropped (MAX_DOCS hit)
- `functional_area` field on each requirement for cascade advisory grouping

### Step 2 — Obvious Requirement Generator (COMPLETE)
- LLM generates requirements so fundamental users expect them but never write them down
- Deduplicates against Step 1 stated requirements
- Rule 9: assigns 'critical' only when absence makes entire app non-functional — most items should be 'high'
- `functional_area` field on each requirement (same grouping scheme as Step 1)

### Frontend (COMPLETE)
- React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- Upload page: drag-and-drop zip + requirements textarea, file size display, validation
- Results: ClassificationResult (Step 0), RequirementsResult (Step 1), ObviousRequirementsResult (Step 2)
- Each requirement row expands to show source quote / reasoning + functional_area badge
- Job list endpoint `GET /api/jobs` lets you find the latest job_id without copying from the frontend

### Backend infrastructure (COMPLETE)
- Python 3.12 + FastAPI
- `POST /api/upload` — validates zip + requirements, creates job, starts background pipeline
- `GET /api/jobs/{job_id}` — returns job JSON
- `GET /api/jobs` — lists recent jobs (most-recent-first, default limit 10)
- Job store: one JSON file per job in `./jobs/{job_id}.json`
- Uploads stored in `./uploads/{job_id}/project.zip`
- Pipeline runs Steps 0 → 1 → 2 as async background task; status tracked in job JSON

## What has NOT been built yet

- Step 3 — L1b Implied Enhancement Generator
- Step 3.5 — Human Confirmation UI (pipeline pauses at `waiting_for_confirmation`)
- Steps 4–17 (see PLAN.md for full pipeline)
- Docker sandbox (Step 11)

## How to run locally

### Backend (port 8000)
```bash
cd c:\Users\Owner\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\DSTA\backend
venv\Scripts\activate          # Python 3.12 venv
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Frontend (port 5173)
```bash
cd c:\Users\Owner\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\DSTA\frontend
npm run dev
```

**npm SSL issue (corporate proxy):** If `npm install` fails with `SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN`, run:
```bash
npm config set strict-ssl false
npm install
```
Or copy `package-lock.json` from another machine where install succeeded — npm will use it without re-hitting the registry.

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

## Key technical decisions

- **AsyncAnthropic** with `cache_control: ephemeral` on system prompt — keeps classification fast and cheap
- **JSON files per job** in `./jobs/` — no database for MVP; easy to inspect and debug
- **Async background task** (FastAPI `BackgroundTasks`) — upload returns immediately with `job_id`, frontend polls
- **Python 3.12 required** — Python 3.14 (pre-release) causes pydantic-core Rust compilation failure on install
- **Formula-driven scores** — LLM never overrides the formula
- **Root-level Python check** — `root_level_py` in Step 0 prevents sub-service requirements.txt (depth 2+) from falsely determining backend_framework
- **Step 1 truncation recovery** — `_parse_llm_response` recovers requirements from truncated JSON responses rather than failing with 0 results

## Git workflow

PAT stored via git credential store. To push:
```bash
cd c:\Users\Owner\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\DSTA
git add <files>
git commit -m "describe what you did"
git push origin main
```

**Required before every commit (no exceptions):**
- Did the design, formulas, or output schemas change? → Update `PLAN.md`
- Were new steps built, bugs fixed, paths changed, or working instructions revised? → Update `CLAUDE.md`

Both files must be in the same commit as the code — not a follow-up commit. This is how context persists across devices and sessions. The local `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/` directory is machine-local only — do not rely on it for cross-session rules.

## Next steps

1. Build Step 3 — L1b Implied Enhancement Generator (`backend/pipeline/step3_implied_generator.py`)
2. Build Step 3.5 — Human Confirmation UI (POST /api/jobs/{id}/confirm, frontend review table)
3. Build Step 4 — Repo Parser (outputs `languages`, `api_endpoints`, `database_models`)

## Known limitations / future scope

### Microservices
The evaluator is designed for **self-contained applications with user-facing flows**. Microservices architectures are out of scope for the MVP for two reasons:
1. Individual services are rarely self-contained enough to evaluate against user-story-level requirements — most are internally-facing and flows span multiple services
2. Steps 5 (L2 Inventory), 9 (Test Generator), and 11 (Sandbox) assume one running app with one base URL and a UI to crawl

**Future implementation:** Microservices support is a post-MVP in-place extension — do not clone the repo. The branch point is `project_type == "microservices"` from Step 0's job JSON, which already flows through the pipeline. Steps 5, 9, and 11 will need a microservices implementation path. To keep this retrofit additive (not a rewrite), ensure the **output schemas** of Steps 5, 9, and 11 remain stable and Playwright-specific logic does not leak into downstream step inputs.
